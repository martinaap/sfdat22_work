# ** Project idea **

* Im planning to predict discrepancies in cost of medical procedures based on geography / age / race / some characteristic
* HealthData.gov has plenty of health data sets
* I know that there will be a lot of data to sift through and potentially a lot of cleaning required. 
* I chose this because I am interested in the affordability of health care
